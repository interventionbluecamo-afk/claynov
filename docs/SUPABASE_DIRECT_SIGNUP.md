## What to Do if Vercel Keeps Popping Up

**The issue**: Sometimes Supabase shows Vercel integration prompts if you came from a link that includes Vercel context.

**The fix**: 
- Use the direct dashboard link above
- Or manually type: `supabase.com/dashboard` in your browser
- Don't click any Vercel integration buttons - just skip them

## After Signup

Once you're in the Supabase dashboard:
1. You should see "New Project" button
2. Follow the rest of `QUICK_SETUP.md` from Step 2 onwards
